Class Summary Chapter - 04 Talk is cheap, show me in code (06/12/2023)
Chapter 04's session, titled "Talk is Cheap, Show Me in Code" on 06/12/2023, delved into developing a configuration-driven UI for a food ordering platform. We initiated the process by outlining the web application's low-level design (LLD) and progressed by crafting layouts, components, and manipulating data from mock sources. Within this session, we explored essential concepts such as props (properties), the virtual DOM, and the significance of unique keys, detailed in my theory-assignment.md.

In my coding-assignment.md, I've shared a step-by-step approach to adopt a React mindset and build applications. Leveraging this knowledge, I created "BiteBliss," a basic food ordering app in this chapter. However, this marks only the initial stage, as numerous enhancements await in the upcoming chapters.

One key takeaway from this chapter is that props passed in components resemble arguments in a JavaScript function call, received by the function definition as parameters.
